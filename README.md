Five men of di erent nationality (England, Spain, Japan, Italy, Norway) live in the
rst ve houses on a street. They all each have a profession (painter, diplomat,
violinist, doctor, sculptor), one animal (dog, zebra, fox, snail, horse), and one favorite
drink (juice, water, tea, coffee, milk), all di erent from the others. Each of the houses
is painted in a color di erent from all the others (green, red, yellow, blue, white).

Furthermore:

The Englishman lives in the red house.
The Spaniard owns the dog.
The Japanese is the painter.
The Italian likes tea.
The Norwegian lives in the leftmost house.
The owner of the green house likes coffee.
The green house is to the right of the white one.
The sculptor breeds snails.
The diplomat lives in the yellow house.
Milk is drunk in the third house.
The Norwegian's house is next to the blue one.
The violinist likes juice.
The fox is in the house next to the doctor's house.
The horse is in the house next to the diplomat's.

The problem is thus to infer who owns the zebra and who drinks water.
